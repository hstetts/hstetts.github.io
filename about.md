<p>I have been working in Technical Support for the last three years gaining experience supporting end users, testing new software functionality, and dabbling in web development. These roles coupled with my curiosity for all things Web served as a driving force to enroll in an intensive 52 Week web development program. When I’m not at work, my focus is on Web Development. I’m either working on my current project, teaching myself a new technology, or brushing up on the one’s I know.</p>

<p>When it comes to technology, knowledge acquisition is limitless. <i> And this is where my passion lies.</i></p>
